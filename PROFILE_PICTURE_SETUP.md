# 📸 How to Add Your Profile Picture

## Quick Setup Instructions:

### Step 1: Save Your Profile Picture
1. **Save your profile image** as `profile-picture.jpg` in the `public` folder
2. **Recommended specifications:**
   - **Format:** JPG or PNG
   - **Size:** 400x400 pixels minimum (square format works best)
   - **Quality:** High resolution for crisp display
   - **File size:** Under 500KB for fast loading

### Step 2: File Location
Place your image file here:
```
myapp/
├── public/
│   ├── profile-picture.jpg  ← Your photo goes here
│   ├── vite.svg
│   └── ...
```

### Step 3: Alternative File Names
If you want to use a different filename, update the Hero component:

**File:** `src/components/Hero.jsx`
```jsx
<img 
  src="/your-filename.jpg"  ← Change this
  alt="CHOY LONG - MIS Professional" 
  className="profile-photo"
/>
```
